🧠 Tic Tac Toe AI – Minimax (C# Windows Forms)

This project is a C# Windows Forms application that implements the Minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI for the classic Tic Tac Toe (X-O) game.

The user plays against the computer, and the AI always chooses the optimal move.

The application also provides a full Minimax decision tree visualization, allowing users to see:

All possible moves evaluated by the AI

The score of each move

How recursion and backtracking determine the final decision

🎯 The AI is mathematically unbeatable — the best possible outcome for the player is a draw.
